 This project allows the user to get all users and thoughts for a social media site. The user can also get, update or destory a specifc users or thought based off its unique id number. The user can also create a new user or thought. The user can also add and delete friends for a specific user based on both user ids. The user can also add and delete reactions to thoughts based on the corresponding ids. This project uses mongoose which allows for the code to be written in a more readable way rather than typing out the raw mongoDB for that action. This is using a non-relationship database.
